This is a trivial redirect to my GitHub profile. This website gets published at
`https://lusmo.re/gh`, and any request to a path under this subdomain will be
redirected to `https://github.com/CurtisLusmore`. For example, a request to
`https://lusmo.re/gh/gh` will redirect to `https://github.com/CurtisLusmore/gh`
(this repository).
